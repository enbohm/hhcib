What needs to be done?
- Design and Layout of the applications, better look and feel
- Using messages resources (no hard coded messages)
- Application.properties file (maybe CDI to inject properties)
- Improve social sharing
- Refactor Facades, add an abstract subject facade
- My Pages needs functionality like changing passwords and deleting (own) subjects.
- Support for supplying a custom connection string to MongoDB (MongoHQ URL hardcoded today)
- Voting handling must be improved, you must not be able to vote on your own subjects.
- A admin page

Getting started:
- Requires Java 7
- Maven 3.x
- Git
- A JavaEE 7 compliant application server (tested on Glassfish 4)
