What needs to be done?
- Design and Layout of the applications, better look and feel
- Using messages resources (no hard coded messages)
- Application.properties file (maybe CDI to inject properties)
- Improve social sharing
- Refactor Facades, add an abstract subject facade
- Support for users and accounts (i.e login support)
- Support for supplying a custom connection string to MongoDB (localhost hardcoded today)

Getting started:
- Requires Java 7
- Maven 3.x
- Git
- MongoDB 2.4.5 (running at localhost, default settings)
- A JavaEE 7 compliant application server (tested on Glassfish 4)
