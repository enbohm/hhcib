This is the HowHardCoultItBe (HHCIB) project. It's web application where people can submit their way of craftmanship things such as 'How to build a swimming pool', 'Preparing a Lobster' 
or 'How making a certain tax reduction'. HHCIB also includes a voting mechanism, social sharing and user management.

What needs to be done?
- Design and Layout of the applications, better look and feel, e.g. login form, menu etc.
- Using messages resources (no hard coded messages)
- Application.properties file (maybe CDI to inject properties)
- Improve social sharing
- My Pages needs functionality like changing passwords and updating E-mail
- Support for supplying a custom connection string to MongoDB (MongoHQ URL hardcoded today)
- A admin page to delete subjecs and users. Page exist, but contains nothing today (admin_page.xhtml)
- A search UI (users should not need to browse categories)

Getting started:
- Requires Java 7
- Maven 3.x
- Git
- A JavaEE 7 compliant application server (tested on Glassfish 4)
- Internet access (since the database is hosted as MongoHQ.com)
